# LoRiggioDev
 A Discord bot for playing Liar's Dice

To get this to work, you need a "config.json" file in the same directory as "LoRiggio.py".
If you don't have one, one will be created the first time you run the program.

This file has to contain the following:
```
{
  "token":  "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
}
```
